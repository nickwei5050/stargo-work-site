/* GSAP SplitText splits "words" on spaces. Chinese has none, so on the Chinese
   pages a whole paragraph became one unbreakable inline-block and its "lines"
   were detected wrongly (text re-wrapped inside each line block). The Webflow
   engine instantiates SplitText itself with a fixed option set, so the class
   is wrapped here — on zh pages only — to supply a word delimiter that:
     · splits between ideographs / kana (each character becomes a word),
     · keeps CJK punctuation attached to the character before it,
     · keeps opening quotes/brackets attached to the character after,
     · leaves Latin runs (a word, "STARGO WORK", "288") intact,
     · keeps a real space where the copy had one (the space rides at the start
       of the next word, which SplitText re-inserts as a space node).
   Loaded after SplitText.min.js and before the Webflow bundle. */
